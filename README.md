The following repository contain my solution to challenges for  the Summer School on Machine Learning and Data Science  organized by [data science africa](http://www.datascienceafrica.org/).

The challenge consist on 3 part:
 - part one is about python Basics.
 - part two  is about Data Science Basics.
 - Part three is about Machine Learning Basics.
 
I have submitted the code and finally get an invitation to the summer school, but will I attend to it?
